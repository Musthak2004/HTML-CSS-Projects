<!-- Example Lists, Tables and Forms -->
<!-- This example demonstrates several of the
 CSS properties we have met in thus chapter to
 control the presentation of lists, tables, and forms -->
<!-- For the list of free poetry events near the start of the page, the bullet
  points are styled with an image. The space between each list item is
  increased using the line-height property.
  
  For the table, the gaps between cells are removed using the borderspacing
  property. Font size is set for the <td> and <th> elements as
  they do not inherit their size from parent elements.

  The head of the table has a darker background, light text, and a dark
  2-pixel line between it and the table content. Rounded corners on the
  table header are created using the :first-child and :last-child
  pseudo classes (for browsers that support rounded corners).
  Alternate rows of the table have different shading, and texture is added
  with different borders on each side of the cell.
  
  For the form, the related form controls are put in a <fieldset> element.
  The labels of the form controls on the left also use the float property to
  ensure the form controls are vertically aligned.

  When the text boxes of the form receive focus, or the user hovers over it,
  the background color and border colors change. The submit button has
  also been styled to make it clear where people should submit the form. -->
