<!-- Example Layout -->
<!-- This example demonstrates a modern
 magazine-style layout using the 960.gs grid.
 Using this style sheet saves us from having to
 create all of the CSS code ourselves. -->
<!-- Several classes from the 960.gs style sheet have been added to the code
  to indicate how many columns of the grid each element should stretch 
  across. As you saw in this chapter, the 960.gs stylesheet uses the float
  property to position the blocks next to each other.
  
  At the start of the page, the header uses fixed positioning (meaning that
  it does not move when the user scrolls down the page). The z-index
  property is added to the header to keep it on top of the remaining
  content as the user scrolls down the page.
  
  Both the header and footer are contained within <div> elements which
  stretch the entire width of the page. Inside those container elements sit
  other elements that use classes from the 960.gs style sheet to ensure
  that the items in the header and footer align with the rest of the content.
  The feature article takes up the entire width of the page. The push_7
  and push_9 classes are part of the 960.gs style sheet and are used in
  the feature article to move the header and the content for this article
  over to the right.
  
  Under the main article you can see four blocks, each of which is 3
  columns wide. These contain images followed by links to more articles.
  This example also uses background images to create a textured
  background for the page and header, and also to contain the images for
  the feature article. You will learn more about these in the next chapter.
  Please note: If you view this example in Internet Explorer 6, the
  transparent PNGs used in this design may have a gray background. To
  learn more about this issue, visit the website accompanying this book
  where you can find a simple JavaScript that fixes this problem. -->
