<!-- Example Text -->
<!-- This example combines many of the techniques shown in this chapter. -->
<!-- The sizes of fonts are controlled using the font-size property. The
    headings are changed from bold to normal using the font-weight
    property. We have also specified different choices of font using the
    font-family property.
    
    The <h1> element uses the CSS3 text-shadow property to create the
    drop shadow behind it. The <h2> element is converted to uppercase
    using the text-transform property, and to make the uppercase text
    easier to read, we have increased the space between each letter using
    the letter-spacing property.
    
    For the main body text, we have increased the line-height property so
    there is a bigger gap between each line of text, thereby making it easier
    to read. In the first paragraph, the first-line pseudo-element allows
    us to style the first line of the introduction in bold. Finally, the credit is
    italicized and aligned to the right-hand side of the page. -->

    <h3>Breed History</h3>
    <p>
      The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred
      for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the
      French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers
      because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World
      War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards
      is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and
      Lafayette all owned briards.
