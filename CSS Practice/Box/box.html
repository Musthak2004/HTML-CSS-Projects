<!-- Example Boxes -->
<!-- In this example, you can see a simple homepage for a music shop -->
<!-- The whole page sits inside a <div> element with an id of page. This is
    centered using the margin property, with a value of auto for the left and
    right margins. The logo and other content are centered using this same
    technique.
    
    The main <div> has a double-lined border around it, and the size of
    this box will expand and contract if the browser window is resized. To
    prevent the page from becoming too narrow or too wide, the min-width
    and max-width properties are used.
    
    The navigation is created using an unordered list. There are borders
    set to the top and bottom of this list to make it stand out. The display
    property has been applied to each of the items in the list so they behave
    like inline (rather than block-level) elements. This enables the navigation
    links to sit next to each other horizontally. The padding property has
    been used to create space between each of the links.
    
    The width property for the <ul> element is set to 570 pixels, and the
    width property for the <p> elements beneath them is set to 600 pixels.
    They actually end up the same width as each other because the <ul>
    element also uses padding to create a gap between the border of the box
    it creates and the links inside of it, and any padding, borders, or margins
    are added to the width and height of the box.
    
    If we had not included a DOCTYPE declaration at the start of this page,
    the sizes of the boxes would be different to each other in Internet
    Explorer 6 because this browser did not implement the box model in the
    correct way. -->
